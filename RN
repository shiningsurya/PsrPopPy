This is my running notes.

- Check out `features to add` file on the repo. They already have plans for it?
They cited MB paper.
- YMW16 code available ? Or should we have to codify it?
-- KK anna used it in his latest paper. Hahahahha
-- We have to put one Environmental variable bc of that.
-- They are shipping an executible. I have to make an FFI for it.
-- They worked in C and not in Fortran hence installing it requires one additional step
| I created a so object of YMW16 like this
| | gcc -c -fPIC *.c -lm
| | gcc *.o -shared -o libymw16
| I hope it works
| export YMW16_DIR=`your directory`


- Can we some testcases where we can test if our code is working fine and if there is a difference between original PsrPopPy
  and our version?
- They have a `tests` directory but it's not complete. We should think of a thorough way and complete way.

- Binary systems have  entirely different cosmological circumstances which lead to their creation. So, when we are using models
used for modeling isolated pulsars aren't we bias-ing our model?

- Do you even MCMC bruh?


Cycle 1 :

- Modify YMW16 model to make it no IO and independent.
-- Strip everything that would lead to IO.
---- What is DM_Host? It is set to 100 as default.
---- Account for FRB?
---- YMW16 has Gal, Magellanic Cloud and IGM. What to do about these?
---- NE2001 has tscat and tscint_bw. Investigate YMW doesn't have similar. Investigate.
